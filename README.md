# Machine Learning Roadmap

There are two pathes in my opinion to study machine learning, the first is the academic path which depends on studying the detailed mathematics behind machine learning and data science algorithms. The other (easier) path is the practical path which focuses on learning the intuition behind those algorithms and applying using frameworks like sklearn or tensorflow

> **NOTE**  
> This roadmap is based on the opinion of the writers, it is not necessarly flawless nor is it necessarly good for everyone, it could work for some and not for others, this is why we make sure to include diverse resources.
